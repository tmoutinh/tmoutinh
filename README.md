<h1>Hi there ðŸ‘‹ðŸ˜ƒ</h1>
<p>
  My name is Tiago, I am a 26 neurobiology master ðŸ§  who believes we should know a little of everything. 
</p>
<p>
  Recently I have also developed an interest in tech which motivated me to learn code at 42 Porto. I will share here some of my projects as well as future endeavours.
  I want to know more about **software development** and **AI** and progress from a scientist to a programmer.
</p>
<sub>  Disclaimer: I had no background in coding, and I am trying to perfect my code writting as I'm evolving in the course.</sub>

## Skills acquired :notebook:
I have been in contact with, used and practiced with:
