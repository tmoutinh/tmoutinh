## Hi there 👋😃
My name is Tiago, I am 24 and I am a neurobiology master 🧠 who believes we should know a little of everything. Recently I have also developed an interest in tech which motivated me to learn code at 42 Porto. I will share here some of my projects as well as future endeavours.
I want to know more about **software development** and **AI** and progress from a scientist to a programmer.

<sub>  Disclaimer: I had no background in coding, and I am trying to perfect my code writting as I'm evolving in the course.</sub>

## Skills acquired :notebook:
I have been in contact with, used and practiced with:
